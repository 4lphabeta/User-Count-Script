# User-Count-Script
Python script that cuts user count times down from 1-2 hours to 3 minutes tops. The script checks all user folders for the last modified date of the VorCfg user file to see when it was last used. Users with a VorCfg modified date of over 6 months are deemed inactive users. The output is as a CSV spreadsheet which should be double checked and sent to accounts.
